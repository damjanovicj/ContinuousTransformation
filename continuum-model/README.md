Continuum helps you Level Up

The Level-Up toolkit, Continuum, is an improvement framework built by Standard Bank engineers intended to assist you on the continuous improvement journey. 

The goal is to continuously improve engineering capability. 

You can use it to build a heat map of relative strengths and areas of improvement for the organisation and/or teams.

This repository contains following files:

High level summary of the model is illustrated in the file 'A3_Hand_out_REV01.pdf.

Continuum model and key assessment principles are explained in 'Continuum Deck final.pdf'.

The visual map contains visual representation of 12 dimensions across 5 levels of maturity, detailing competencies under each dimension and level. 'Continuum Visual Map v 0.pdf' is the original version. As the model is improved, the revised visual maps will be added to the repository. We will keep all versions for your reference. The latest revision will be indicated by version number. 

The excel representation of the competencies per dimension/level is provided in ‘Continuum in Excel – map’ file.
